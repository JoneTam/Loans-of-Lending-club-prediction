Here you will find the four models specifically crafted to predict a range of variables for Lending Club business automation. Additionally, an exploratory data analysis was conducted, which encompassed creating statistical summaries and charts, scrutinizing for anomalies, investigating correlations and other interdependencies between variables. Moreover, comprehensive statistical inference was performed, involving the definition of the target population, formulation of multiple statistical hypotheses, construction of confidence intervals, determination of significance levels, and execution of t-tests for these hypotheses. These models have undergone hyperparameter tuning with Optuna and thorough model selection analysis before being containerized using Docker. Subsequently, an application was developed utilizing FastAPI, and the models were deployed to Google Cloud, enabling access via HTTP requests.
