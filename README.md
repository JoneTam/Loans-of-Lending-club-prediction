# Loans-of-Lending-Club-Prediction

Welcome to the Loans of Lending Club Prediction project! Here, we have developed four specialized models designed to predict various variables for Lending Club business automation. Alongside these models, an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, involving the creation of statistical summaries and charts, anomaly scrutiny, investigation of correlations, and exploration of interdependencies between variables.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA.ipynb file, we delved into:

- Statistical summaries and charts
- Anomaly detection
- Correlation exploration
- In-depth statistical inference
- Definition of the target population
- Formulation of multiple statistical hypotheses
- Construction of confidence intervals
- Determination of significance levels
- Execution of t-tests for hypotheses
## Model Development
In Modeling.ipynb file the four models underwent a rigorous development process:
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Thorough model selection analysis
## Containerization with Docker:
- The selected models were containerized using Docker for efficient deployment and scalability.
## Deployment:
- The models are accessible through an application developed using FastAPI. The deployment was done on Google Cloud, enabling easy access via HTTP requests.
